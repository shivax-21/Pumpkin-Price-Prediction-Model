## Overview
The Pumpkin Price Prediction model aims to forecast pumpkin prices across different months in various cities in the USA using machine learning techniques. The model leverages linear and polynomial regression models to capture both simple and complex patterns within the data.

Pumpkin prices can vary significantly based on factors such as variety, city, and packaging type. By analyzing historical price data, the model seeks to provide an accurate and reliable price prediction model that can be used by farmers, retailers, and market analysts to make informed decisions.
## Features 
* Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of various features affecting pumpkin prices.
* Visualization: Graphical representations of data trends and model performance.
* Linear Regression: A model to understand the linear relationship between the features and pumpkin prices.
* Polynomial Regression: A more complex model to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
## Tools & Libraries
#### Hereâ€™s what I used to bring this project to life:
* Python: The core programming language.
* Jupyter Notebook: For coding and experimenting.
* Pandas: To handle and explore the data.
* Numpy: For all the number crunching.
* Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the models.
