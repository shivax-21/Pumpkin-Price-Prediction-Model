## Overview
The Pumpkin Price Prediction model aims to forecast pumpkin prices across different months in various cities in the USA using machine learning techniques. The model leverages linear and polynomial regression models to capture both simple and complex patterns within the data.

Pumpkin prices can vary significantly based on factors such as variety, city, and packaging type. By analyzing historical price data, the model seeks to provide an accurate and reliable price prediction model that can be used by farmers, retailers, and market analysts to make informed decisions.
## Features 
* Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of various features affecting pumpkin prices.
* Visualization: Graphical representations of data trends and model performance.
* Linear Regression: A model to understand the linear relationship between the features and pumpkin prices.
* Polynomial Regression: A more complex model to capture non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy.
## Tools & Libraries
#### Hereâ€™s what I used to bring this project to life:
* Python: The core programming language.
* Jupyter Notebook: For coding and experimenting.
* Pandas: To handle and explore the data.
* Numpy: For all the number crunching.
* Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the models.
## Installation

## Usage
1. Data Preprocessing:
  * Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
3. Model Training:
  * Train the linear and polynomial regression models using the preprocessed data.
3. Model Evaluation:
  * Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
4. Visualization:
  * Visualize the results to understand the relationship between different features and the predicted prices.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts provided in the repository to execute these steps.
## Dataset
The dataset contains information on different pumpkin varieties, packaging types, cities, and historical prices across different months. The data was collected from various sources and preprocessed to ensure quality and accuracy (Download it from within in the repository ``).
